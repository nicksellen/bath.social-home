Who: Nick, Hollie, Rosie, Paul

motivations:
- a drop in for all kinds of people in Bath I don't know
- inspired by opening up random conversations with people
- always rushing, how grounded am I as I pass through
- more grounded and present in the place I'm in
- practise session for that
- interested in communities of people over similar interests
- meeting new people, immersing in Bath, being new, getting together helping out
- overusing facebook, don't like it, think about leaving, but it's still useful
- possibilities to create online social network with advantages without downsides
- exploring that, come to a better relationship with facebook, examine that
- finding out what promotes real social in person contact, big issue, loads of people addicted

random notes!

- everyone hates facebook! scrolling through all day, good angle to push it out
- how does it mitigate against addictive or negative behaviour
- ego gets involved, how to get rid of dopamine hit addiction?

- enjoying face to face on screen, slight randomness, and trusting it'll go somewhere interesting
- like bumping into each other at a bus stop :)

- maybe keeping the jitsi room to have a space for random encounters, bump into people
- re-learning how to be in community again
- we've lost our way with social media 
- we've lost our non-commercial social spaces

- we're overusing our dopamine system, should only be used selectively
- oxytocin/soothing system, campfire

- possibilities to share interesting wisdom/tips/histories via bots
- ties into point about where museum content belongs

- important use finding out things that are on
- encouraging people to meet up in person, not just be on the computer

- next meeting in the pub!
- more than tech! nice social events... 

- non-commercial social spaces to meet
- cafe near green park, e.g. mooshed

rough ideas for next steps:
- Nick and Hollie interested to work on putting site online for pilot
- Paul and Rosie interested to chat with people about it, and join more sessions
- Paul up for joining Nick on his next evening town wandering :)
- everyone up for a next in-person/pub meeting to keep chatting about these topics
