Our first "tech working" session!

Nick suggested the steps of:
- get us a small VPS server
- get the co-op cloud tool set up (abra)
- install mastodon (or hometown fork) using it!

What happened was:
- we checked out hetzner, bytemark, and krystal VPS hosting
- hetzner was much cheaper and Nick had good experience there already
- we wondered which account to use to set up, whose email?
- we setup an email address BathSocial@protonmail.com to use
- we registered a hetzner organisational account BathSocial
- Nick used his card to buy a small VPS 4.75EUR/month (CPX11) 2GB
- yay! we have a server, called "Larkhall" (the part of Bath we were sat in)
- Hollie uses Windows, so we went through the WSL (windows subsystem on linux) setup
- that worked nicely
- we ate some food

So, next step is to continue with setting up the co-op cloud tool, get server access, and get started with it.

We figured we can treat it disposably for now, if we mess up the setup we can always just recreate it all.

We also need to secure the server at some point, TBD how to approach that.
