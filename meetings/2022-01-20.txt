Our first tech meeting :) Quite informal.

- both feeling a bit bad we didn't progress it any more yet
- getting tech infrastructure set up next will make it more tangible
- not wanting to plan too much, let is emerge!
- not too difficult, we have the capabilities
- nice base for doing this, we both see lots of people with dissatisfaction about existing social media
- the potential in-person aspect is quite interesting
- next step to have a session to start actually setting it up

We organised an "afterwork" session to work on it the following week.
