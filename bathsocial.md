# bath.social

### What?

A co-operatively owned social media platform for Bath and it\'s
surrounding area.

-   run, managed, and owned by it\'s members
-   focused on regenerating a more socially and ecologically aware Bath
-   not centred on any one project, but supporting informal connections
    between people across many different projects
-   \... plus people not active in any projects, who just want to chat
    and see what is going on
-   not just for worthy content: cat/food pics, and funny memes too!

### Why?

-   the big social media sites (Facebook/Twitter/etc) are build on a
    model of [Surveillance
    capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism)
    (*\"an economic system centered around the commodification of
    personal data with the core purpose of profit-making\"*)
-   informal ad-hoc chat is really important to build ecosystems
-   individual projects tend to have their own silos of communication
-   a great exercise in citizen empowerment!
-   locally focused, yet plugged into the wider ecosystem is a great
    model

### How?

Fortunately we don\'t need to build anything, all the tools are already
there! [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) is a great alternative to
twitter that is already deployed at scale (over 4 million users). But
unlike Twitter it\'s made up of lots of independent sites that all can
talk to each other.

In my experience it\'s a much calmer and less
attention-seeking/celebratory focused way to do social media.

This guide might help understand a bit more about that → [How Does
Mastodon Work?](https://kevq.uk/how-does-mastodon-work/)

There are many examples of how this works in practise:

-   [toot.wales](https://toot.wales/about) - focused on Wales
-   [social.coop](https://social.coop) - co-operatively run by it\'s
    members (I\'m part of this one)
-   [wien.rocks](https://wien.rocks/about) - similer idea, but for
    Vienna
-   \... many more I\'m sure

It can be an [open collective](https://opencollective.com/how-it-works)
community, which means we can manage the finances, and don\'t need to
create a legal entity. Much like [how social.coop does
it](https://opencollective.com/socialcoop).

It also doesn\'t need to be at [bath.social](https://bath.social), I
just looked for domains and it only cost a fiver, and it\'s a pretty
cool domain name, so I just got it. Everything up for discussion.

### What next?

Great, so you\'re interested? It\'s only me
([Nick](https://nicksellen.co.uk)) right now, and I just threw this page
together\... it\'s an experiment\...

I\'d like to get:

-   1 or 2 other tech-aware people - don\'t need to be a developer
    though
-   1 or 2 other human-aware people - zero-tech knowledge is perfect!
-   a sense that a bunch of other people would join it and try and get a
    critical mass

Get in contact to join or share thoughts/questions/enthusiasm:

-   **bath.social** telegram group →
    [t.me/+3llfevOWXyFkYzdk](https://t.me/+3llfevOWXyFkYzdk)
-   write me privately on telegram →
    [telegram.me/nicksellen](https://telegram.me/nicksellen)
-   write me privately by email → <bathsocial@nicksellen.co.uk>

And soon after a video call perhaps\...

**Nothing will happen if nobody joins in, I\'m not into one-person
projects!**

### Who are you anyway?

I\'m Nick (see about me at
[nicksellen.co.uk](https://nicksellen.co.uk)), I grew up in Bath, do
community/people-focused \"tech\" projects, and looking to apply some of
my skills and knowledge to the social and ecological regeneration of
Bath.

I was managing the tech side of [social.coop](https://social.coop)
before, so I know what I\'m doing there.

As soon as it\'s not just me, we can rewrite this page!
